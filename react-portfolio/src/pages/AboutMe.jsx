      <p className="bio-text">
        I'm an IT professional with a passion for both the human mind and the
        digital world. With degrees in psychology and accounting, I have
        cultivated a unique blend of skills that allow me to navigate the
        complexities of human behavior and financial systems with equal ease. My
        journey into the world of languages began with a fascination for
        communication, leading me to study Russian, Spanish, Polish, and German.
        Each language has enriched my understanding of the world and enhancing
        my ability to connect with people from various backgrounds.

      <p className="bio-text">
        In addition to my linguistic endeavors, I have also delved into the
        realm of technology by studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These
        programming languages have empowered me to create and design engaging,
        user-friendly websites, merging my analytical skills with my creative
        vision. My background in psychology helps me design digital experiences
        that are not only visually appealing but also intuitive and
        user-centric. Balancing my expertise in psychology, accounting, and
        technology, I am committed to leveraging my diverse skill set to make a
        meaningful impact in both my professional and personal life.
