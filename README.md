## Description

A well-crafted coding portfolio is more than just a digital resume; it's a dynamic showcase of your skills and creativity. The React framework allows for the development of complex, single-page applications, enabling developers to present their projects in a user-friendly and engaging manner. A React-based portfolio can include features like smooth animations, interactive elements, and responsive design, demonstrating a strong grasp of modern web development techniques.

As a former CPA and current NetSuite Administrator learning web development, I've utilized React to create a portfolio that highlights my technical abilities and problem-solving skills. This portfolio serves as a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and my ability to apply new technologies to real-world projects. By showcasing a diverse range of projects, from simple static websites to complex web applications, I aim to demonstrate my versatility and potential as a skilled web developer.
